# Table of Contents and Code Examples :
Below is a list of methods currently implemented in the repo.


 ## 1.Missing Values: 
- [View File](https://github.com/dipesh4036/Feature-Engineering/blob/main/Handling%20Missing%20values.ipynb)

-> first find isnull.sum to NAN column
- Imputation Missing Values:
 	- 1. Mean Value Imputation-   If diagram give Normal Distribution
 	- 2. Median Value Imputation- If we have outliers in the dataset use median
	 - 3. Mode Imputation Technqiue- Categorical values
     
## 2. Handling Imbalanced Dataset:
- [View File](https://github.com/dipesh4036/Feature-Engineering/blob/main/Handling%20Missing%20values.ipynb)
- Upsampling
- Down Sampling

## 3. SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):
- [View File](https://github.com/dipesh4036/Feature-Engineering/blob/main/SMOTE.ipynb)
- This is also Handling Imbalanced Dataset Technique.

## 4. Data Interpolation:
- [View File](https://github.com/dipesh4036/Feature-Engineering/blob/main/Data%20Interpolation.ipynb)
- Data interpolation is the process of estimating unknown values within a dataset based on the known values.

## 5. Handling Outliers:
